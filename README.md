# My Research
Cognitive-motor interference research investigates how postural control demands affect cognitive task performance and vice versa. We measure postural control parameters continuously with a force-plate during quiet standing while participants do different cognitive tasks and analyse them in an event-related manner. Our main focus is on a dual-task paradigm in which we generate a memory consolidation bottleneck which interferences with postural processes.

# Abstract
Cognitive-motor interference research suggests that balance control adapts dynamically to cognitive demands. Using a hybrid Psychological Refractory Period paradigm, we investigate how temporal expectancy, induced through manipulations of stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA: 100 vs. 1000 ms), influences balance adjustments assessed as sway variability when standing on a force plate. Participants perform a visual-vocal short-term memory task and an auditory-manual reaction time task, while SOA and task load (report vs. ignore a visual object) are varied blockwise. We additionally analyze sequential SOA effects in previously submitted data, where SOA was varied trialwise. Based on the dynamic cognitive-motor interference framework, we predict that balance adjustments occur strategically before task onset and after task completion. Consequently, sway variability should be increased before and after the task with greater temporal precision when SOA is blocked or when SOA sequences allow for expectancy-based preparation. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of how predictability modulates the interaction between cognitive and motor control in dual-task contexts in the range of sub seconds.
